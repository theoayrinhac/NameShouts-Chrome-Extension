# NameShouts Extension for HubSpot

Chrome Extension using NameShouts API to add names pronunciation on hubspot.

## How it works

Enter a valid API key for Nameshouts by clicking the NameShouts icon in the extension bar, or create one.
Then on every contact page of HubSpot next to the person name, you'll find an icon, allowing you to hear the pronuncitaion of the name. If the icon is green the full name in in the NameShouts Database, if it's orange, then only part of it was found. If the icon is grey then no information was found.
